# What is DevilutionX

DevilutionX is a source port of Diablo and Hellfire that strives to make it simple to run the game while providing engine improvements, bugfixes and some quality of life features.

Check out the [manual](https://github.com/pionere/devilutionX/wiki) for what features are available and how best to take advantage of them.

For a full list of changes see our [changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

# How to Install

Note: You'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't have an original CD then you can [buy Diablo from GoG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo).

Download the latest [DevilutionX release](https://github.com/pionere/devilutionX/releases) and extract the contents to a location of your choosing or [build from source](#building-from-source).

- Copy `DIABDAT.MPQ` from the CD or GOG-installation (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-the-.MPQs-from-the-GoG-installer)) to the DevilutionX folder.
- To run the Diablo: Hellfire expansion you will need to also copy `hellfire.mpq`, `hfmonk.mpq`, `hfmusic.mpq`, `hfvoice.mpq`.

For more detailed instructions: [Installation Instructions](./docs/installing.md).
