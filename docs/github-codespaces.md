A GitHub codespace container with all dependencies and several useful tools preinstalled is configured in the `.devcontainer` directory.

You can go to https://github.dev/diasurgical/devilutionX/ and immediately begin developing.

To view the graphical desktop of the container, click Ports > Browser.

The password is `vscode`.
