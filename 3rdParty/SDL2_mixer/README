This is a slightly modified version of libsdl-org/SDL_mixer@5d3c84e5dd4c91093255ad5533b8457ecc40684f

Changes:

* Removed all files not used by DevilutionX.
* Comment out unnecessary bits with `#ifndef FULL`.
* Simplified source management
  - Reading only from memory sources (MEM_OPS)
  - Mix_RWops are not freed and no need to call RWclose (SRC_PTR)
  -- SDL_RWops is always freed (FREE_SRC) --
* Limited support for formats
  - Only u8-bit or s16-bit lsb WAV formats are supported (WAV_SRC)
  - only mono or stereo, 22050Hz or 44100Hz, s16-bit lsb music is supported (SELF_CONV)
  - silence assumed to be zero (SILENCE)
  - loops are not supported (WAV_LOOP)
  - encoding of the music (wav) file is not maintained (WAV_ENC)
  - decoder assumes pcm encoding (MUS_ENC)
* MIX_MAX_VOLUME changed from SDL_MIX_MAXVOLUME to 2048
* MIX_DEFAULT_FREQUENCY changed from 44100 to 22050
* MIX_CHANNELS changed from 8 to 25 and fixed number of (RESERVED)CHANNELS are used (FIX_CHAN)
* MIX_MAX_POS_EFFECT(_F) changed/defined from 255 to 16
* Sfx on non-stereo/22050 devices are streamed by SDL (FIX_OUT)
  - Panning is only for AUDIO_S16LSB with 2-channels
* meta tags are ignored (META)
* Fading, expire are not supported (FADING)
* Mix_Chunk is an alias for Mix_Audio (CHUNK_ALIAS)
* Volume per chunk is not supported (CHUNK_VOL)
* allocated is no longer maintained in mixer.c (CHUNK_ALLOC)
* Chunk length is not validated in Mix_PlayChannelTimed (CHUNK_LEN)
* Mix_Chunk.lastChan field added to store the last channel assuming the first channel is reserved (CHUNK_LAST_CHAN)
* music_active is no longer maintained in music.c (MUS_ACTIVE)
* Only one music can be played at a time, it uses a static buffer (FIX_MUS)
* Channel(chunk) Looping is not supported (LOOP)
* Seeking of music is not supported (SEEK)
* Hooks on music-playback are not supported (HOOKS)
* Large files (not fit to int) are not supported (FILE_INT)
* Music is always looped (MUS_LOOP)
* SDL_MIXER_DISABLE_* are not supported (MIX_DIS)
* SDL_MIXER_HINT_DEBUG_MUSIC_INTERFACES disabled (HINTS)
* Only one audio device is allowed at a time (SINGLE)
* Mix_FreeChunk assumes the chunk is not played (CHUNK_CHECK)
* Mix_Playing, Mix_Volume assume valid channel-id
* Mix_LoadMUSType_RW is simplified
  - assumes not-null SDL_RWops (MUS_CHECK)
  - SDL_RWops is not reset when load fails (MUS_CHECK)
  - autodetection of type is disabled (WAV_SRC)
* Mix_LoadWAV_RW is simplified
  - assumes not-null SDL_RWops and initialized audio device (WAV_CHECK)
  - assumes the data-length matches the format (SAMPLE_CHECK)
  - uses Mix_LoadAudio_RW(previously Mix_LoadMUSType_RW) to load WAV-meta info (MUS_LOAD)
    WARNING! LoadWAVMusic is incomplete (WORD alignment is not followed, FMT parsing is not flexible, etc...)
* Effects on channels are internalized -> extra checks disabled (EFF_CHECK)
* Maximum one effect per channel (FIX_EFF)
* Assumes initialized SDL with SDL_INIT_AUDIO (INIT)
* volume is applied in GetSome (SOME_VOL)
* SDL1 compatible (USE_SDL1)
* zero-fill in init_position_args is commented out
